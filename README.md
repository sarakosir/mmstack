## Vision

Hey, thanks for checking out @mmstack! :) We're building an awesome ecosystem of libraries focused on highly reactive, type-safe, and performant tools, diving deep into areas where standard Angular patterns sometimes leave us wanting more – especially when chasing truly fine-grained reactivity and predictable state. Think advanced async/resource management [@mmstack/resource](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mmstack/resource), signal forms [@mmstack/form-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mmstack/form-core), powerful signal utilities [@mmstack/primitives](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mmstack/primitives), a high-performance data grid (in progress...), routing/preload helpers [@mmstack/router-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mmstack/router-core) & more. If that piques your fancy, give some of them a try, & you'll be sure to love 'em.

## Key packages

`@mmstack` provides a suite of libraries to enhance your Angular development experience:

- **[`@mmstack/object`](./packages/common/object/README.md):** Lightweight, type-safe object and data structure utility functions. Mostly an internal utility library TBH :)
- **[`@mmstack/primitives`](./packages/primitives/README.md):** Foundational utilities and primitives for enhancing Angular Signals (`debounced`, `mutable`, `stored`, `mapArray`, etc.).
- **[`@mmstack/resource`](./packages/resource/README.md):** Powerful, signal-based primitives for managing asynchronous data fetching and mutations (caching, retries, circuit breakers, etc.).
- **[`@mmstack/router-core`](./packages/router/core/README.md):** Signal-based utilities for reactive integration with the Angular Router state (`queryParam`, `url`, upcoming preload features).
- **[`@mmstack/form-core`](./packages/form/core/README.md):** Provides the core primitives (`formControl`, `formGroup`, `formArray`) for building flexible, type-safe, signal-based reactive forms.
- **[`@mmstack/form-validation`](./packages/form/validation/README.md):** A composable, type-safe, and localizable validation system designed for `@mmstack/form-core`.
- **[`@mmstack/form-adapters`](./packages/form/adapters/README.md):** Headless, reusable state adapters for common form field types, bridging form logic and UI components.
- **[`@mmstack/form-material`](./packages/form/material/README.md):** A set of Angular Material components that directly consume state adapters from `@mmstack/form-adapters` for easy form building.

**Upcoming Libraries:**

- **`@mmstack/table-core`**: (Upcoming) Headless core logic for a high-performance, signal-based data table/grid.
- **`@mmstack/table-client`**: (Upcoming) Client-side data handler (sorting, filtering, pagination etc.) for `@mmstack/table-core`.
- **`@mmstack/table-material`**: (Upcoming) Angular Material components for rendering the `@mmstack/table-core` state.

## Versioning

The major version of @mmstack libraries (e.g., v18.x.x, v19.x.x) aligns with the major version of Angular they are designed for. This ensures clear compatibility.

Within a major version, minor and patch versions follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- Minor versions (X.y.0) introduce new, non-breaking features.
- Patch versions (X.Y.z) provide backwards-compatible bug fixes.
